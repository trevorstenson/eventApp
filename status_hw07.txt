Web Dev Spring 2021 HW07 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
Trevor Stenson


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/trevorstenson/eventApp


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
events.downwind.xyz


4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
Everything works. In fact, I believe I went too far and added authorization required
for adding/deleting/updating both posts and users. You can view lists of these resources
without logging in, but to change any of the data you need to login.


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
It is.


6. If you would like the deployment for an old homework to be reconsidered, what
are the links to your Inkfish submission and deployed site?
No need.


And here's a list of tasks for grading comments. Just leave this here:
